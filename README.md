QUANTLUDO
A modified version of ludo based on quant is here!!!The twist is that here the winner is the one who has been able to get maximum number of sixes in 20 dice rolls. The random numbers on die  are generated using a circuit in Qiskit which we have used as a replacement for the randit function based in Python. The main advantage of this is the increase in speed of generating numbers. We have also designed an interface  but were not able to merge it with the code due to time restrictions. 
  
HOW TO RUN?
1)Install python and its modules, including Pygame.
2)Install qiskit
3)Open quantum ludo folder on your computer.
4)Execute main.py using the python command.
HOW TO PLAY?
With the roll of dice, a random number is generated and the piece moves on the ludo board.Each player rolls the die consecutively one after the other. Since the maximum die rolls is 20, each player will be able to roll dice 5 times .The one who achieves maximum number of sixes at the end,is the winner.
